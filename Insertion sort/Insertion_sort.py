Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Properties:
Worst-case performance O(n^2)
Best-case performance O(n)
Average case performance O(n^2)
